# Move
A simple android game made with Processing and the Android mode.

## Objective
You need to take the meteors, and run from the red ones.
While you are getting some points, you will became some planets, when you get 100 points, you will became earth, so you will need to run from every meteor.<br><br>

## How to run the project?
You can just download the [Move.apk](https://github.com/viniciuseb/Move/raw/master/Move.apk) file from the repo and install it on you android device.

Or you can build the project, just installing the Processing IDE, the Android mode and the Sound library.

Here is the Processing IDE download link: [Processing IDE Download](https://processing.org/download/)<br>
Here is a tutorial about how to install the Android mode on your Processing IDE: [Android mode tutorial](https://android.processing.org/install.html)<br>
The easiest way to install the Sound library is through Processing's Contribution Manager.

After installing the Processing, the Android mode and the Sound library, you need to download the repo, and open the Move.pde file and click run.

Remember to open your Processing in Android mode, the project should work fine in real devices.
